It's always nice to see, when your software is getting bigger and better. I am happy to announce
that we started translation tool on [crowdin.com](https://crowdin.com/) (**thanks** for Open-Source license)!

This tool will help us to bring our bot to more people than before and even you can join to help translate bot to your language.
